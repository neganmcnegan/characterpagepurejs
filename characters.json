    "has the fashion sense of a color blind toddler",
    "no one know his name is ignatius and if they do they don't share that information. his name is nash, that's it.",
    "wears his heart on his sleeve.",
    "profoundly ashamed of his wealth. feels like he is stealing something from someone every time he uses any of it.",
    "has an iq of 186 but its not like it matters or something. (except it does secretly, he cares a lot about it. too much of his self worth is attached to the idea of being smart. every time he does something dumb, he thinks it takes away from it somehow.)",
    "loves animals and children, because of course he does.",
    "so convinced love is sacrifice that if he didn’t have to give away something to be with the person he loves, he would think that there is something wrong with the relationship",
    "he doesn’t even know he is insecure and wrong about the way he thinks of relationships. isn’t that adorable? (it’s not, it’s ruining his life.)",
    "loves chocolate and deserts of all kinds. if he is mad at you and you get him a donut, he is no longer mad at you. he is that easy. it’s always time for cake.",
    "loves poetry so much. just so much. he wants to quote it halfway through a conversation. every conversation actually. all the conversations.",
    "okay hear him out— music is poetry you sing.",
    "he just loves words and languages, he is a word loving little guy.",
    "has never met someone he won’t immediately start caring for.",
    "has never met a troubled person he won’t immediately want to save.",
    "prefers riding horses to riding a motorcycle, but prefers riding his motorcycle to driving.",
    "wears his cowboy hat mostly all the time.",
    "calls people ma’am and sir or kid. those are the only pet names he uses. maybe when really in love he can say sweetheart.",
    "would rather ignore his own emotions and just focus on helping everyone else.",
    "unironically recites poetry mid conversation.",
    "tries to be understanding and patient but honestly thinks his way is usually the best way and things would be a lot easier in life if everyone just started listening to him.",
    "thinks it’s his job to clean up people’s messes.",
    "lowkey judging people for doing wrong shit. given the chance will call them out. also given the chance will make them correct the “wrong” behavior.",
    "the type of person to spend lots of hours trying the same thing over and over again, because he wants to get it right and he is sure he can do it if he just tries a little harder for just a little longer. no he can’t stop right now.",
    "taps and touches and nudges and points and pulls closer.",
    "can speak about seven different languages. read in fourteen.",
    "rarely ever lets people in on how smart he can actually be. because if they don’t know, what they say doesn’t matter. but if they do know and somehow they say he isn’t that smart, he will fall apart and never find a way to be put back together again.",
    "rebels in tiny small ways that aren’t obvious even to himself, like refusing to tie his uniform tie when he was in school. or refusing to drive when his family owns a car company. or never having learned to tie a tie even though in a family of businessman he probably should have at some point.",
    "thinks he is a cowboy, he is nothing else. not someone who likes art, or someone who is smart. just a cowboy. so attached to the sense of self he created over the years that he wouldn’t know how to function if he was forced to give up his accent, horse and cowboy hat, even if there is a lot more to him.",
    "can sing and play guitar and actually likes music because music is poetry, but way underplays how much because that’s his brother theo’s thing and two people in the same family couldn’t possibly have the same interest, right?",
    "adhd and autistic highkey.",

      "needs reading glasses and for some reason picked the squarest, brownest possible frame",
      "pierced his ears while in college but won't tell anyone that, though you can tell at close inspection",
      "has never taken a single goddamn picture of himself that wasn't old man coded. as in, weirdly framed, slightly out of focus, either too close or too far, succeeding in making even the most handsome of men look unflattering",
      "doesn't share with people that his name is ignatius. his name is nash, that's it.",
      "set the family lawyers on a fun little war with wikipeadia where every now and again the family lawyers manage to get the name nash there and then some (in nash's opinion) pedantic, little asshole comes back and corrects it to ignatius.",
      "wears his heart on his sleeve.",
      "profoundly ashamed of his wealth. feels like he is stealing something from someone every time he uses any of it.",
      "has an iq of 186 but its not like it matters or something. (except it does secretly, he cares a lot about it. too much of his self worth is attached to the idea of being smart. every time he does something dumb, he thinks it takes away from it somehow.)",
      "loves animals and children, because of course he does.",
      "so convinced love is sacrifice that if he didn’t have to give away something to be with the person he loves, he would think that there is something wrong with the relationship",
      "he doesn’t even know he is insecure and wrong about the way he thinks of relationships. isn’t that adorable? (it’s not, it’s ruining his life.)",
      "loves chocolate and deserts of all kinds. if he is mad at you and you get him a donut, he is no longer mad at you. he is that easy. it’s always time for cake.",
      "loves poetry so much. just so much. he wants to quote it halfway through a conversation. every conversation actually. all the conversations. cringe is something he doesn't have access to. nash can only do profoundly sincere.",
      "loves every type of art actually. paintings and poetry and music and interpretative dancing and actually archetecture is just visual art you live in and same goes for cars actually and ads are just a really good speech to convince you of something. art is everything, if you would let him just—",
      "really does love poetry way more though, he will vaguely remember the date one patinging he likes was made in, but he can correctly quote this one poem he read one time, because it lives in his brain rent free",
      "he just loves words and languages, and he needs to learn every language in world because he needs to know what his favorite poem sounds like in all fo them and how the translator chose to change the sentence so the feeling would stick, because this word doesn't exist in this language and—",
      "can (and given the opportunity will) rent for six straight hours about art.",

      "lowkey judging people for doing wrong shit. given the chance will call them out. also given the chance will make them correct the “wrong” behavior.",

      "the type of person to spend lots of hours trying the same thing over and over again, because he wants to get it right and he is sure he can do it if he just tries a little harder for just a little longer. no he can’t stop right now. just let him—",
      "taps and touches and nudges and points and pulls closer.",
      "can speak about seven different languages. read in fourteen. wants to learn more, there is no such thing as being done with education just let him learn a little more. he has time.",
      "never learned to tie a tie.",
      "rarely ever lets people in on how smart he can actually be. would rather pretend he is just a dumb cowboy with a silly little hat and a propensity to get into fights than you know the full complex picture of him. because if they don’t know, what they say doesn’t matter. but if they <i>do</i> know and they call him dumb (evne jokingly) he will fall apart and never find a way to be put back together again.",
      "thinks he is a cowboy, he is nothing else. not someone who likes art, or someone who is smart, or someone willing to sacrifice everything for his family. he is just a cowboy. and it's healthy actually to make your sense of self as small and simple as you can. his own idea of himself cannot and should not contain the entire complexity of his being. he is a sterotype that he saw in a movie as a kid, a shadow of a memory of the man he wished his grandfather could have been, he is a cowboy living in the family ranch, taking care of animals for no complex or upsetting reasons.",

        "nash — well, little nash — was a problem, that's what he was, what teachers and principals and school consolers said. a little ball of excited energy who needed to much convincing to understand that sometimes things were just how they were. a boy who should learn to respect authority. a perfectly capable yound man who should know better than to live his uniform tie untied despite the multiple warnings he recieved",
        "nash got sent away to a boarding school from the moment he could walk. and he liked school, he did, he liked learning. but in all honesty, his favorite times were always the ones wehere he got suspended.",
        "when some administrator had enough and sent him to spend a week home. when nash got to pack up, sleep in a jet and wake up to his grandpa waiting for him. and it was bad at first, yes, sure, but all he had to do was sit through a talking to and then— then his grandfather would sit with him and they would read together. giant old books people at school would say he was too little to under. then his gradfather would take him out to ride a horse, tell him old stories, talk about long gone men and all of their tales. then, well, what he really loved was to go with his grandfather to roosevelt motors. he would go to the office and he would sit on the edge of william roosevelt's desk and he would given a riddle or puzzle to try and figure it out while he worked, all the way up until he finally did, yes, and then he would get another and another. all the way until the day was over.",
        "that was the best time.",
        "he never did understood why he couldn't just stay home, stay with his grandpa, go to a normal school that ended at three and spend the rest of the afternoon at the company",
        "not until little richie was old enough to go along and then nash couldn't come back, didn't want to get suspended. would wear his tie even sometimes.",
        "because his little brother was there, and if he went back home, his little brother would be alone. and sometimes their schedules were similar enough that they could play together",
        "one year later, and theo was there too and the three of them could hang out.",
        "he wasn't alone. he was with his family. just far from home.",
        "they went back home during summers, yes, and sometimes his grandpa was too busy to stay with him. but by then <i>nash</i> could tell the stories. <i>nash</i> could take them out to pet the horses at the family ranch even if he couldn't take them on rides. nash could give them puzzles just like his grandpa did.",

        "not only him no, but everyone else in there. managers and board members and business associates. all wearing a tie around their necks",
        "it was some project at school. something about what you are gonna do with your life. it wasn't important. he had the grades. but he was doing it. he was doing it and a friend of his joked about it while everyone else at the table laughed. <i>which one of your families' companies are you gonna be the owner of nash?</i>. because he didn't need to finish, they knew already, everyone did, that's what he was going to do with his life.",

        "so he got drunk. he got profoundly drunk. he bought a plane ticket and he flew home with nothing but the school uniform he was wearing and he cried the whole way back home.",
        "his grandfather was there. in his office, besides the little wall of accomplishments he had for each of his grandchildren, smiling at him, asking with both humor and concern <i>what are you doing at home, son?</i>",
        "and at sixteen years old, eyes still red from tears, body still wobbly with alcohol, nash confessed the truth. he didn't want it. he didn't like it. he like poetry and music and he wanted to be an english teacher in some local high school or sing or write or— he didn't want roosevelt motors, or the roosevelt empire, or any of it actually. he wanted to live somewhere where his voice didn't echo. he wanted to see his grandpa more often. he wanted so very little— and god, he was sorry.",
        "his grandfather hugged him, held him. put him to sleep in his own wing of the roosevelt mansion. and he promise it was fine, if he didn't want it he didn't need to do it.",

    "second oldest of the roosevelt brothers. and like every one of his brothers, the product of a one night stand, or so he believes.",
    "he could never remember how old he was, whether he was ten or eleven. him and theo had always been so close that in those first few years their ages got coupled together <i>when</i> they <i>were twelve</i>, <i>when</i> they <i>were thirteen</i>, that’s how people talked about it, even if he was always one year and some change older than theo.",
    "the exact date always escaped him, he just remembered he was at the roosevelt christmas ball, his favorite event. nash was being introduced to a bunch of strangers again. his mom was nowhere to be seen. nate with a babysitter and him and theo were playing some game of tag that involved too many complicated rules through a crowd. weaving through strangers and laughing a little too loud.",
    "he just ran into the man. it was an accident. richard offered out a million apologies right away, but the guy was wrong, he could tell, and he wasn’t listening.",
    "the stranger asked for his name, looked him down like someone who had been sold a better product than the one delivered and said, something, something like “thank god you don’t look like me.”",
    "richard just stood there.",
    "he couldn’t stop the stranger either. not before he went on a little tirade about how he was better off staying away, he would never take a dna test so don’t even ask, hell, richard should tell his mom she’d never see a single cent of his money, not a one, he would rather burn it down than pay for her cab.",
    "richard didn’t say anything. didn’t move, even.",
    "theo found him standing in the same spot a good five minutes later, long after the man had left. but when theo asked him what had happened, he just said ‘nothing’.",
    "he had always been terrible anyway, at talking, at explaining himself. he never could do it in a way that didn’t make himself sound awful.",
    "he tried. when nash gave up on the spot as heir and their grandfather shifted his attention towards richard. he went up to nash’s wing and offered him a stolen beer. he sat at the foot of his brother’s bed and talked for a while. and he asked ‘please, don’t be mad at me.’",
    "because it didn’t matter, not for nash, it never would. he was the first born, the smartest, the nicest, the most intelligent. the moment he changed his mind, their grandpa would give him the spot back. it didn’t matter because, even if you put all that aside, he just liked nash too, in an uncomplicated way. nash had the same interests as their grandpa, they shared puzzles and favorite books and jokes richard’s inability to comprehend french didn’t let him get.",
    "it didn’t matter because he didn’t have to convince their grandfather to like him. not like richard had. like he was lying to make himself sound like a good option. but nash didn’t care. he was mad at the world and richard was just part of it.",
    "he tried explaining it to theo too. when richard spending his every moment trying to live up to what nash had been meant richard spending every moment around their grandfather, and very few of them around theo.",
    "he caught him in the hallway after class. knowing he was late for rowing team, while people ran in different directions around him, while theo’s friend told him to hurry up. he tried ‘please, man, you gotta get it.’",
    "because, fuck, it didn’t matter for theo. there was this thing about him, this thing about his fucking smile. it never mattered what he was doing, people just liked him, anyway. he could break the rules and he would get a cookie for coming up with a clever work around. richard had to try. but theo didn’t listen. he laughed, said it’s fine, told him to relax. they would find time later, summer was right around the corner.",
    "he even tried explaining to nate. which he shouldn’t have really. because when he was fifteen, nate was just eight. a kid who didn’t know anything but the fact that nash was mad, and theo was sad and richard was gone. richard caught him in the game room alone, throwing a ball against the wall and challenging himself to catch it. he offered to play a game with him, tried a ‘please, just—’ but he never finished that thought he just ended up crying."

    "it never stopped really.",
    "his breath would catch every time her hands brushed his. his gaze would find hers across every room. the world would stop and hold for a few seconds, whenever she said his name.",

    "she was theo’s. for the last few years of school. she was theo’s, for the year he went off to college and they stayed behind. she was theo’s and theo’s only.",
    "she was theo’s until the summer where she came knocking at his door in the middle of the night, saying she couldn’t do this anymore, couldn’t spend another night pretending she didn’t want him.",
    "she was theo’s until she kissed him and then she wasn’t anymore.",
    "for all the months that followed, they talked around their betrayal. mornings and afternoons wasted with theo, and alcohol, and lavish parties, with fast cars, endless jokes, stupid dares. with the three of them friends like they had always been.",

    "he went back to college when summer ended and it was <i>theo</i> who called to tell him the good news. she was pregnant! they were having a baby.",

    "he saw nash ran out first, heard the sirens after, their grandfather the last to leave.",
    "nate stood at the door and asked richard if maybe he didn’t want him to take noah so he could go over and find out what’s happening.",
    "noah held his thumb like he was asking him not to leave.",
    "she was buried one week later and part of theo went with her.",
    "and when it was all said and done, even thinking about it seemed like an unfair thing to do to theo.",
    "he couldn’t, no, he didn’t know, didn't know what that would do to theo, what it would do to both of them if the answer was yes. she was theo’s wife, noah was theo’s kid, and that was the end of it.",
    "besides he loved noah anyway, he didn’t need him to call him dad to do it."

    "Second youngest of the Roosevelt brothers. And like every one of his brothers, the product of a one-night stand.",
    "People always talked about Theo Roosevelt as though he was a thing of wonder. They never really meant it as a compliment, no, but did that matter? Easy laugh, charming smile, bright blue eyes brimming with trust.",
    "Theo's first wondrous feat was beating death.",
    "It happened when he was five. Too young to form any real concrete memories beyond vague distress. Theo only ever heard the whole thing through stories. Some mythical tale of some strange bee. It always seemed bigger in it than it could have ever been in real life. Bumblebees didn’t grow past an inch. But when people talked about it, they said always said it was horrible. Scary, bloody, monstrous. Sometimes, the bee grew along with the tale, became a whole hive.",
    "From what Theo remembered, the real event was very simple, actually. He was playing outside with his brother Richard when he stepped on a bumblebee. He hadn’t noticed much wrong until Richard did. He thought he had stepped on a rock or something, cut himself. He wanted to keep playing, he just couldn't breathe. There was a lot of yelling, running, , calling for help. He remembered Nash clutching his hand so hard it hurt. He remembered hospital lights, babysitters and staff and gossip. He remembered his grandpa showing up a few hours later in the hospital, telling him he’d have to carry around an epipen now just in case. He remembered his mom back from Europe a week later calling him resurected as a joke.",
    "Theo wasn’t scared during it. No, really. It was later that he'd found himself clutching his throat before going to sleep, trying to breathe while coughing out noises like a clogged windpipe. His body mimicking the breathlessness of it all, without a real reason for it.",
    "He would sneak into Richard’s bedroom then. Sleep on the couch near his bed. Sometimes Richard would sense his distress and come to him instead. Theo left to onto the certainty that if something happened without his notice, then at least Richard would be there to call for help.",
    "Theo's second wondrous feat was being William Roosevelt’s favorite. At least that’s what people said, how they framed. Nash, the child prodigy, firstborn, best, most sensible choice. Richard, hardworking and ambitious, deserving of the spot for sheer sense urgency and need. They did not know how Theo, strange child that Theo was, with an inclination for music and too much time spent outside staring at the stars, usurped it from both boys.",
    "How strange, how quaint, how wonderous.",
    "Theo didn’t feel like the favorite.",
    "Or if he did, he didn't know why it was that people always talked about it like his grandpa had made a mistake, picking him instead of any of the other better choices. Like he'd performed a tricking of some sort by making the great William Roosevelt like him, when he clearly didn't deserve it",
    "There were a few tiny ones too, along the way. A few tiny magical feats. He skipped a grade in kindergarten, another in middle school. Which meant by the time he got to high school, he was in the same grade as his brother Richard. He'd performed alongisde orchestras packed full of adults when he was only fourteen. He manage to keep the sort of smile that convinced small children to calm down and figures of authorities even past the age where awkwardness should start to settle in. It was magic."

    "If you asked <i>Theo</i>, the second most wondrous thing he had ever managed to do was meet Emily Lambert.",
    "It was the summer before their senior year. He was wasting his days away at the country club, and she was working part-time.",
    "They talked for one hour only that first day, and Theo knew it was love like he knew the skies were blue and he was breathing.",
    "From the one, they spent every day of that summer together. Laughing, playing, partying.", 
    "And when it ended, he had begged his grandfather to let her come with him to his private boarding school in Switzerland. Donate a new building to the school, ask a favor from the dean, pay her tuition, and promise good grades.—His grandfather agreed to it, of course, under the condition that Theo went to university after graduation.",
    "Then it was him and her and Richard. His best friend, the love of his life. They spent every moment together, out in their own little world of adventures, starting parties, getting in trouble, making a mess out of the world around them.",
    "The rest of the world didn’t really matter. School even less. They were living in a magic realm of their own. Theo still graduated high school as salutatorian. (Because Richard was valedictorian, of course.) Because he knew how quickly his grandfather could take this away from him if he didn’t behave as ordered. But it didn’t matter.",
    "Richard left for college like he always meant to do, and Theo begged his grandfather to allow him a gap year or two. So he and Emily could settle, get married, so the world could fall into place.—They traded on Theo’s life like concessions required approval. A gap year for the promise that when Theo did go to college, he’d choose engineering. Another for the promise that when he and Emily got married, they would live in the Roosevelt estate. A final one for a chance at picking Theo’s first son’s name.",
    "Emily hated every single promise made. She hated it, and she hated Theo’s grandfather, and she made it known to anyone wondering, but it didn’t matter.",
    "He married Emily the summer after he graduated. Exactly two years after having met her. And the summer after that, she was pregnant.",
    "Theo knew that his brother, Richard, loved Emily. He couldn’t blame him; she was easy to love. But he didn’t care, it didn’t matter. Because Emily loved him. Richard would never do anything with her, Theo knew that, and she was his. In every way that mattered. She had chosen him in every way that was important. Nash could have his genius. Richard could have the spot as CEO. Theo had Emily.",
    "The third most wondrous thing that Theo ever did was die. Third, because, well, he thinks it should be higher on the list, but most everyone else calls his assessment theatrical, dramatic.",
    "It was two months after Noah was born.",
    "Richard had stayed behind with the baby that night, promised to take care of him. He had always cared about him more than he cared about anyone else in the world.",
    "(TW: Death) Theo went out with Emily to the lake in the Roosevelt estate. She had insisted. Something about wanting to feel wild again, less motherly, more free.",
    "The two of them jumped off the cliff into the water, but only he came out of it.",
    "The first thing he did was call for help.",
    "The second was go back to look for her.",
    "He spent the entire night there, diving back into the muddy dark water. Even after the police and emergency services arrived, even after they had insisted that he stop looking so they could work. Even after his grandma and Nash showed up to look at him pitifully.",
    "He only left when they removed him. Physically dragged away by Nash while they pulled her body out of the water.",
    "He didn’t speak for a week after. They never really pulled him out of the water, if he was being honest. Maybe they pulled her, but whoever Theo was, he died in the lake with her that day.",
    "It took him a week to speak, a month to manage to go outside. About three to sleep through a night. He kept dreaming that she was asleep next to him, waking up to an empty bed and finding himself unable to move for an hour, at least.",
    "The most wondrous thing Theo ever did was Noah Roosevelt.",
    "It was five AM, probably, he was lacking good sleep. The world a cloud of dark and grey and fear. He turned to his son in his crib, and Noah was awake, looking at him. All Theo did was ask, 'What?' and his baby burst into laughter. It was the best sound he’d ever heard. Music couldn’t compare to it.",
    "he still went to college, majored in mechanical engineering, minored in music. there was no breaking promises in the roosevelt household.",
    "he thought it was funny too, that his grandfather named noah, only for noah to change his name to noah when he turned ten. never to be known as whatever william roosevelt had picked. he always was ten times better than anything theo could dream of being."

    "Second youngest of the Roosevelt brothers. And like every one of his brothers, the product of a one-night stand.",
    "People always talked about Theo Roosevelt as though he was a thing of wonder. They never really meant it as a compliment, no, but did that matter? Easy laugh, charming smile, bright blue eyes brimming with trust.",
    "Theo's first wondrous feat was beating death.",
    "It happened when he was five. Too young to form any real concrete memories beyond vague distress. Theo only ever heard the whole thing through stories. Some mythical tale of some strange bee. It always seemed bigger in it than it could have ever been in real life. Bumblebees didn’t grow past an inch. But when people talked about it, they said always said it was horrible. Scary, bloody, monstrous. Sometimes, the bee grew along with the tale, became a whole hive.",
    "From what Theo remembered, the real event was very simple, actually. He was playing outside with his brother Richard when he stepped on a bumblebee. He hadn’t noticed much wrong until Richard did. He thought he had stepped on a rock or something, cut himself. He wanted to keep playing, he just couldn't breathe. There was a lot of yelling, running, , calling for help. He remembered Nash clutching his hand so hard it hurt. He remembered hospital lights, babysitters and staff and gossip. He remembered his grandpa showing up a few hours later in the hospital, telling him he’d have to carry around an epipen now just in case. He remembered his mom back from Europe a week later calling him resurected as a joke.",
    "Theo wasn’t scared during it. No, really. It was later that he'd found himself clutching his throat before going to sleep, trying to breathe while coughing out noises like a clogged windpipe. His body mimicking the breathlessness of it all, without a real reason for it.",
    "He would sneak into Richard’s bedroom then. Sleep on the couch near his bed. Sometimes Richard would sense his distress and come to him instead. Theo left to onto the certainty that if something happened without his notice, then at least Richard would be there to call for help.",
    "Theo's second wondrous feat was being William Roosevelt’s favorite. At least that’s what people said, how they framed. Nash, the child prodigy, firstborn, best, most sensible choice. Richard, hardworking and ambitious, deserving of the spot for sheer sense urgency and need. They did not know how Theo, strange child that Theo was, with an inclination for music and too much time spent outside staring at the stars, usurped it from both boys.",
    "How strange, how quaint, how wonderous.",
    "Theo didn’t feel like the favorite.",
    "Or if he did, he didn't know why it was that people always talked about it like his grandpa had made a mistake, picking him instead of any of the other better choices. Like he'd performed a tricking of some sort by making the great William Roosevelt like him, when he clearly didn't deserve it",
    "There were a few tiny ones too, along the way. A few tiny magical feats. He skipped a grade in kindergarten, another in middle school. Which meant by the time he got to high school, he was in the same grade as his brother Richard. He'd performed alongisde orchestras packed full of adults when he was only fourteen. He manage to keep the sort of smile that convinced small children to calm down and figures of authorities even past the age where awkwardness should start to settle in. It was magic."

    "If you asked <i>Theo</i>, the second most wondrous thing he had ever managed to do was meet Emily Lambert.",
    "It was the summer before their senior year. He was wasting his days away at the country club, and she was working part-time.",
    "They talked for one hour only that first day, and Theo knew it was love like he knew the skies were blue and he was breathing.",
    "From the one, they spent every day of that summer together. Laughing, playing, partying.", 
    "And when it ended, he had begged his grandfather to let her come with him to his private boarding school in Switzerland. Donate a new building to the school, ask a favor from the dean, pay her tuition, and promise good grades.—His grandfather agreed to it, of course, under the condition that Theo went to university after graduation.",
    "Then it was him and her and Richard. His best friend, the love of his life. They spent every moment together, out in their own little world of adventures, starting parties, getting in trouble, making a mess out of the world around them.",
    "The rest of the world didn’t really matter. School even less. They were living in a magic realm of their own. Theo still graduated high school as salutatorian. (Because Richard was valedictorian, of course.) Because he knew how quickly his grandfather could take this away from him if he didn’t behave as ordered. But it didn’t matter.",
    "Richard left for college like he always meant to do, and Theo begged his grandfather to allow him a gap year or two. So he and Emily could settle, get married, so the world could fall into place.—They traded on Theo’s life like concessions required approval. A gap year for the promise that when Theo did go to college, he’d choose engineering. Another for the promise that when he and Emily got married, they would live in the Roosevelt estate. A final one for a chance at picking Theo’s first son’s name.",
    "Emily hated every single promise made. She hated it, and she hated Theo’s grandfather, and she made it known to anyone wondering, but it didn’t matter.",
    "He married Emily the summer after he graduated. Exactly two years after having met her. And the summer after that, she was pregnant.",
    "Theo knew that his brother, Richard, loved Emily. He couldn’t blame him; she was easy to love. But he didn’t care, it didn’t matter. Because Emily loved him. Richard would never do anything with her, Theo knew that, and she was his. In every way that mattered. She had chosen him in every way that was important. Nash could have his genius. Richard could have the spot as CEO. Theo had Emily.",
    "The third most wondrous thing that Theo ever did was die. Third, because, well, he thinks it should be higher on the list, but most everyone else calls his assessment theatrical, dramatic.",
    "It was two months after Noah was born.",
    "Richard had stayed behind with the baby that night, promised to take care of him. He had always cared about him more than he cared about anyone else in the world.",
    "(TW: Death) Theo went out with Emily to the lake in the Roosevelt estate. She had insisted. Something about wanting to feel wild again, less motherly, more free.",
    "The two of them jumped off the cliff into the water, but only he came out of it.",
    "The first thing he did was call for help.",
    "The second was go back to look for her.",
    "He spent the entire night there, diving back into the muddy dark water. Even after the police and emergency services arrived, even after they had insisted that he stop looking so they could work. Even after his grandma and Nash showed up to look at him pitifully.",
    "He only left when they removed him. Physically dragged away by Nash while they pulled her body out of the water.",
    "He didn’t speak for a week after. They never really pulled him out of the water, if he was being honest. Maybe they pulled her, but whoever Theo was, he died in the lake with her that day.",
    "It took him a week to speak, a month to manage to go outside. About three to sleep through a night. He kept dreaming that she was asleep next to him, waking up to an empty bed and finding himself unable to move for an hour, at least.",
    "The most wondrous thing Theo ever did was Noah Roosevelt.",
    "It was five AM, probably, he was lacking good sleep. The world a cloud of dark and grey and fear. He turned to his son in his crib, and Noah was awake, looking at him. All Theo did was ask, 'What?' and his baby burst into laughter. It was the best sound he’d ever heard. Music couldn’t compare to it.",
    "he still went to college, majored in mechanical engineering, minored in music. there was no breaking promises in the roosevelt household.",
    "he thought it was funny too, that his grandfather named noah, only for noah to change his name to noah when he turned ten. never to be known as whatever william roosevelt had picked. he always was ten times better than anything theo could dream of being."
